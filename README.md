# GitPHREAKERS
A horrible misuse of github repos!

What happens when you turn a joke into a serious idea for a Hackathon?
nothing good of course!
The goal of gitPHREAKERS was to make a multiplayer game hosted entire on github repos. Turns out, thats very hard, **very bad** idea, so we used servers instead! V2, though? now thats another story...

GitPHREAKERS is a game with high ambitions, and even lower achievments!
Original goals:
  >A sleek, smooth UI
  
  >Competitive gameplay, with complicated scripting and battles emerging from its simple rules and systems.
  
  >An engaging race to the top, with the game announcing the victor at one million points!

What we got:
  >A pretty good UI
  
  >Half finished gameplay, with scripting entirely missing!
  
  >An engaging race to... nowhere?
  
  >Unbelievably OP miners
  
(Seriously, invest in miner stocks, theyre going WAY up)

On a serious note, A single person can only do so much. Despite its half finished state, im actually pretty happy with what I got. Its not particularly impressive, but its built on difficult technologies, and ended up shockingly close to done. Another six hours, maybe.

Also if the github pages doesnt work, thats because I forgot to install an ssl cert on my server until the very end, so its self signed. Might make the browser reject the connection to the game server.
